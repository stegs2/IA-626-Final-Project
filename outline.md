### Preliminary Project Outline
The first link shown above is the most up-to-date coronavirus data for NYC.  There are various files hosted on the github page like one that lists confirmed cases per zip code (in NYC).  This data set is updated daily to keep track of the coronavirus in NYC.  The second link contains real-time data from NYCDOT speed sensors on various highways in the five boroughs.  I want to combine this data to see if there is one, a decrease in traffic volume due to the travel restriction imposed on NYC, and two, see if there is some type of relationship between number of positive cases and travel volume.  The coronavirus data is in the form a .csv file in tabular format.  The traffic data is on data.cityofnewyork.us and can be retrieved from an API.  This data will need a bit of preprocessing before it can be combined with the coronavirus data.
After doing some preliminary exploration on the data, I do not think each row represents a car.  The data from March of 2019 contains 1,040,659 rows while the data from March of 2020 contains 1,027,351.  A decrease of about 13000 rows which seems insignificant when compared to the total number of rows.  I am going to continue to assess if I can combine this data with the coronavirus data to gain any meaningful insight.
